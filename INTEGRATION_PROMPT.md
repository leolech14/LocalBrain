# LocalBrain Integration & Completion Request

## Project Overview
LocalBrain is a Tauri 2.0 desktop application that serves as an AI-powered command center for macOS. It combines voice control, terminal automation, file management, and AI orchestration in a privacy-focused, local-first design.

**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/leolech14/LocalBrain.git

## Current State
The project has a solid foundation with:
- ✅ Tauri 2.0 RC backend with Rust
- ✅ React 18 frontend with TypeScript
- ✅ Ultra-compact black UI with resizable panels
- ✅ Component structure for all major features
- ✅ Database setup with SQLCipher
- ✅ Plugin system architecture

## What Needs Integration & Completion

### 1. **Voice System Integration** 🎙️
**Current**: Components exist but need wiring
**Needed**:
- Connect VoiceRecorder → OpenAI Whisper API → Chat input
- Implement wake word detection ("Hey Brain") using Web Audio API
- Wire TTS responses through OpenAI or local Piper
- Add visual feedback (pulsing cyan orb) during recording
- Handle microphone permissions properly

### 2. **Terminal Integration** 💻
**Current**: Terminal component and Rust PTY backend exist separately
**Needed**:
- Connect xterm.js frontend to Rust PTY backend via Tauri commands
- Implement proper session management (create, destroy, resize)
- Add multi-tab support with session persistence
- Stream terminal output to AI for context-aware assistance
- Handle ANSI escape codes and colors properly

### 3. **AI Orchestration** 🤖
**Current**: Store setup exists but no LLM integration
**Needed**:
- Implement OpenAI GPT-4o integration in capabilities provider
- Create proper prompt engineering for system instructions
- Add streaming responses in chat UI
- Implement context management (files, terminal output, etc.)
- Handle rate limiting and errors gracefully
- Add offline mode with Ollama fallback

### 4. **File System Operations** 📁
**Current**: FileExplorer UI exists
**Needed**:
- Implement Tauri file system commands (read, write, delete)
- Add drag-and-drop file context injection
- Implement file preview (text, images, code with syntax highlighting)
- Add Git status integration for version control awareness
- Respect allowed_roots security restrictions

### 5. **State Management** 🔄
**Current**: Basic Zustand store exists
**Needed**:
- Proper state synchronization between Rust and React
- Settings persistence in SQLCipher database
- Session state management
- Undo/redo functionality for file operations
- Real-time updates across all panels

### 6. **Security & Permissions** 🔒
**Current**: Basic structure exists
**Needed**:
- Implement proper sandboxing for file access
- Add command approval system for dangerous operations
- Implement audit logging for all actions
- Handle API key encryption properly
- Add SSO/OIDC support for enterprise

### 7. **Build & Distribution** 📦
**Current**: Basic Tauri build setup
**Needed**:
- Code signing configuration for macOS
- DMG creation with proper icons and metadata
- Auto-update system via GitHub releases
- Crash reporting (opt-in) with Sentry
- Performance optimization (bundle size < 50MB)

### 8. **Testing & Quality** 🧪
**Current**: No tests
**Needed**:
- Unit tests for Rust backend (tokio-test)
- React component tests (Vitest + Testing Library)
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Integration tests for Tauri commands
- Performance benchmarks

## Priority Order
1. **Core Functionality** (Week 1)
   - AI integration (OpenAI connection)
   - Terminal functionality
   - Basic file operations

2. **Voice & Interaction** (Week 2)
   - Voice recording and transcription
   - Wake word detection
   - TTS responses

3. **Polish & Security** (Week 3)
   - State management
   - Security hardening
   - Error handling

4. **Distribution** (Week 4)
   - Build optimization
   - Code signing
   - Documentation

## Technical Constraints
- Must work on macOS 13+ (Intel & Apple Silicon)
- Maintain < 50MB bundle size
- All data stays local (except API calls)
- Must handle offline gracefully
- Performance: < 100ms UI response time

## Success Criteria
- [ ] User can say "Hey Brain" and dictate commands
- [ ] Terminal commands execute and show output
- [ ] Files can be dragged into chat for context
- [ ] AI responds with awareness of terminal/file context
- [ ] Settings persist between sessions
- [ ] App launches in < 2 seconds
- [ ] No memory leaks after 8 hours of use
- [ ] Signed DMG installs without security warnings

## Questions for Implementation
1. Should we use OpenAI's new Realtime API for voice?
2. Do we need local Whisper model support initially?
3. Should terminal sessions persist between app restarts?
4. What's the preference for state management (Zustand vs Jotai)?
5. Should we implement plugin API in v1 or defer?

## Recommended Approach
1. Start with integration tests to verify Tauri bridge
2. Implement core features with mock data first
3. Add real API integrations incrementally
4. Focus on happy path, then error handling
5. Performance optimization last

Please help us systematically integrate and complete LocalBrain, focusing on making it a production-ready application that delivers on its promise of being an AI-powered command center for developers.
