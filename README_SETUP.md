# LocalBrain Setup Instructions

## Getting the Project Files

The LocalBrain codebase was generated as pseudo-files in the conversation above. To set up the project:

### Option 1: Manual Setup (Recommended for learning)

1. Create each file manually by copying from the code blocks above
2. Follow the directory structure exactly as shown

### Option 2: Semi-Automated Setup

1. Copy all the generated output (starting from "Part 1: Root Configuration Files") into a file called `generated-output.txt`

2. Use the extraction script:
```bash
node scripts/extract-files.js < generated-output.txt
```

Note: You'll need to manually clean up the extraction since the format includes both code and explanatory text.

### Option 3: Direct Creation

Since I'm an AI assistant, I can help you create specific files directly. Just ask me to "create [filename]" and I'll write it to your filesystem.

## After Files Are Created

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Run in development mode:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
pnpm build:mac
```
