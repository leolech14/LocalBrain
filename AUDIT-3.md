Summary
Added a status document outlining the current functionality and gaps across chat, terminal, voice, and file-explorer features

Confirmed extensive backend command registration for chat, file operations, terminal sessions, voice, and more in the Tauri layer

Frontend chat component sends messages and transcribes voice input via backend invokes

Terminal UI creates sessions and streams user input to the backend terminal handler

Voice recorder initiates voice sessions and pushes audio chunks for processing

File explorer lists directories and retrieves Git status through backend commands

Testing
pnpm --filter @localbrain/desktop dev

pnpm --filter @localbrain/desktop test *(fails: no tests found)*

pnpm --filter @localbrain/desktop lint *(fails: eslint-plugin-react missing)*

# LocalBrain Current State

## Working Features
- [ ] Chat UI renders (ChatPanel component present)
- [ ] Chat sends messages to OpenAI (`sendMessage` invokes `chat_completion`)
- [ ] Terminal UI renders (`TerminalPanel` uses xterm)
- [ ] Terminal executes commands (`create_terminal`, `terminal_send_input` handlers)
- [ ] Voice button starts recording (`VoiceRecorder` uses `start_voice_session`)
- [ ] Voice transcribes to text (`voice-transcript` event handling)
- [ ] File explorer shows files (`read_directory` command)
- [ ] Files can be read/previewed (`read_file`/`write_file`/`delete_file` commands)

## Partially Working
- [ ] No automated tests (`pnpm --filter @localbrain/desktop test` reports none)
- [ ] Linting fails: missing `eslint-plugin-react`
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @localbrain/desktop dev` starts Vite server; full Tauri integration untested

## Not Working / Not Verified
- [ ] Chat to OpenAI requires API key and was not run
- [ ] Voice and terminal backends unverified in headless environment
- [ ] File previews not tested
