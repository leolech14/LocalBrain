# LocalBrain Complete Integration Guide

## ðŸš¨ Important Context
This project has been worked on by multiple agents. There's:
1. A recent PR that may have added/changed functionality
2. An analysis from a different agent that examined the codebase
3. Potential inconsistencies between what different agents implemented

**Repository**: https://github.com/leolech14/LocalBrain.git

## First Steps: Discovery & Assessment

### 1. Audit Current State (CRITICAL - Do This First!)
```bash
# Clone and examine the latest code
git clone https://github.com/leolech14/LocalBrain.git
cd LocalBrain

# Check recent changes
git log --oneline -20
git diff HEAD~5..HEAD --stat

# Verify what actually exists vs what's documented
find apps/desktop/src-tauri/src -name "*.rs" | xargs grep -l "command"
find apps/desktop/src/components -name "*.tsx" | xargs grep -l "invoke"
```

### 2. Test What's Actually Working
```bash
# Try to run the app and see what works
pnpm install
pnpm --filter apps/desktop dev

# Test each major feature:
# - Can you type in chat? Does it call OpenAI?
# - Does the terminal render? Can you type commands?
# - Does voice recording start? Does it transcribe?
# - Can you browse files? Do they preview?
```

### 3. Map the Integration Points
Look for these specific connection points:

**Backend â†’ Frontend Commands**:
```rust
// In main.rs - what commands are ACTUALLY registered?
.invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![
    // List all commands here
])
```

**Frontend â†’ Backend Calls**:
```typescript
// Search for all invoke() calls
grep -r "invoke(" apps/desktop/src/
```

## Integration Strategy (Adaptive)

### Phase 1: Verify & Document Reality (Day 1)
Create a truth document about what ACTUALLY exists:

```markdown
# LocalBrain Current State

## Working Features
- [ ] Chat UI renders
- [ ] Chat sends messages to OpenAI
- [ ] Terminal UI renders  
- [ ] Terminal executes commands
- [ ] Voice button starts recording
- [ ] Voice transcribes to text
- [ ] File explorer shows files
- [ ] Files can be read/previewed

## Partially Working
- [ ] Feature X works but Y is missing

## Not Working
- [ ] Feature Z is completely broken
```

### Phase 2: Minimal Viable Integration (Days 2-3)

**Goal**: Get the three core features minimally working together

#### A. Chat + Context
```typescript
// Find where chat messages are sent and add context
const sendMessage = async (message: string) => {
  // 1. Check if this function exists
  // 2. Add terminal context if available
  // 3. Add file context if available
  
  const context = {
    terminal: getLastTerminalOutput?.() || '',
    files: getSelectedFiles?.() || []
  };
  
  // Modify the invoke call to include context
}
```

#### B. Terminal Connection
```typescript
// Find the TerminalView component
// Check if it's already wired to backend
// If not, add the minimal connection:

useEffect(() => {
  // Create session
  const setupTerminal = async () => {
    try {
      const id = await invoke('create_terminal_session');
      // Store session ID
    } catch (e) {
      console.error('Terminal command not found:', e);
      // Document what's missing
    }
  };
}, []);
```

#### C. Voice Pipeline
```typescript
// Find VoiceRecorder component
// Check what it does with audio
// Wire transcription to chat input:

const onTranscriptionComplete = (text: string) => {
  // Find the chat input state/method
  // Insert the transcribed text
  setChatInput?.(text);
  // or
  appStore.getState().setInput?.(text);
};
```

### Phase 3: Fill Critical Gaps (Days 4-5)

Based on Phase 1 findings, implement only what's missing:

**If Terminal Backend is Missing**:
```rust
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn create_terminal_session() -> Result<String> {
    // Minimal implementation
    let session_id = Uuid::new_v4().to_string();
    // Store in state
    Ok(session_id)
}
```

**If Voice Transcription is Missing**:
```rust
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn transcribe_audio(audio_data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<String> {
    // Call OpenAI Whisper
    // Return transcript
}
```

**If File Operations are Missing**:
```rust
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn read_file(path: String) -> Result<String> {
    // Check permissions
    // Read file
    // Return content
}
```

### Phase 4: State Persistence (Days 6-7)

Only after core features work:

```rust
// Add to existing database.rs or create new
impl AppState {
    pub async fn save(&self) -> Result<()> {
        // Save current state to SQLite
    }
    
    pub async fn load() -> Result<Self> {
        // Load previous state
    }
}
```

## Flexible Implementation Checklist

Use this to track what you actually need to do:

### Discovery
- [ ] Cloned latest code
- [ ] Identified what PR changed
- [ ] Tested current functionality
- [ ] Documented actual state
- [ ] Found integration points

### Core Features
- [ ] Chat works standalone
- [ ] Terminal works standalone  
- [ ] Voice works standalone
- [ ] File browser works standalone

### Integration Points
- [ ] Chat can receive terminal context
- [ ] Chat can receive file context
- [ ] Voice output goes to chat input
- [ ] Terminal output can be captured
- [ ] Files can be read and injected

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Error handling for all commands
- [ ] Loading states in UI
- [ ] Offline mode fallbacks
- [ ] Settings persistence
- [ ] Security checks

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Command not found" Errors
```typescript
// Frontend is calling a command that doesn't exist
// Solution: Either implement the command or remove the call
try {
  await invoke('missing_command');
} catch (e) {
  console.warn('Command not implemented yet');
  // Fallback behavior
}
```

### State Management Confusion
```typescript
// Multiple agents might have used different state approaches
// Find the truth:
// - Check if using Zustand (stores/appStore.ts)
// - Check if using React Context
// - Check if using Tauri state

// Pick one and migrate everything to it
```

### Duplicate Implementations
```rust
// Multiple agents might have implemented similar features
// Search for duplicates:
grep -r "create.*session" apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/
grep -r "transcribe" apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/

// Keep the most complete implementation
```

## Recommended Approach for New Agent

1. **Don't Trust Documentation** - Test everything yourself
2. **Start Small** - Get one feature fully working before moving on
3. **Document Reality** - Update docs to reflect actual state
4. **Incremental PRs** - Small, focused changes
5. **Test Each Step** - Verify integration points work

## Success Criteria (Minimal)

Week 1 Success = These three things work:
- [ ] Type in chat â†’ Get AI response
- [ ] Type in terminal â†’ See command output  
- [ ] Click voice â†’ Speak â†’ See transcription in chat

Week 2 Success = Integration works:
- [ ] AI knows about terminal output
- [ ] Voice input triggers AI response
- [ ] Can drag file to chat for context

Week 3+ = Polish:
- [ ] Settings persist
- [ ] Sessions restore
- [ ] Errors handled gracefully

## Emergency Fallback Plan

If the codebase is too fragmented:

1. **Identify Core Working Piece** (probably UI)
2. **Mock Everything Else** temporarily
3. **Replace Mocks One by One** with real implementations
4. **Test Continuously**

Remember: It's better to have 3 features working perfectly than 10 features half-broken.

## Final Advice

- Run the app immediately and see what breaks
- Read the git history to understand what changed
- Don't assume anything works until you test it
- Focus on connecting what exists before adding new features
- Ask for clarification if critical pieces are missing

Good luck! The foundation is there - you just need to connect the dots properly.
