===== ANALYSIS 1 =====

Repository assessment
LocalBrain already defines Maple as the default OpenAI TTS voice and sets the “Hey Brain” wake phrase through environment variables, preparing the app for voice activation out of the box
The codebase contains a WakeWordDetector component that simulates wake-word recognition but still uses an energy‑based placeholder rather than a dedicated model, highlighting a key gap in real wake‑word functionality
Voice sessions are configured in the backend with fields for STT and TTS providers (“openai” or local fallbacks) and defaults such as the “whisper-1” model and “maple” response voice, but the STT/TTS functions need deeper integration and robustness to be production ready
The app store keeps wake-word, STT, and TTS settings together with toggles like auto_speak_responses; it also injects recent terminal output into chat prompts so the LLM sees command‑line context when replying
ChatPanel already forwards voice transcripts into the chat stream, which means once true wake‑word handling and STT are wired up, spoken commands will appear as normal chat messages automatically
For tools and file access, the backend exposes read/write/copy/move/delete operations and even an execute_system_command helper, enabling the API‑driven LLM to manipulate the filesystem and run commands inside the allowed-root sandbox

Commentary: despite IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md claiming full voice support, MISSING_COMPONENTS_ANALYSIS.md and the code itself show the wake‑word path is still a stub and critical elements like full STT/TTS integration, database, and PTY terminal are unfinished

Implementation guide
Real wake-word & sleep phrase detection

Replace the energy-based placeholder in WakeWordDetector.tsx with a proven wake-word library (e.g., Porcupine or openWakeWord). Train/detect “Hey Brain”.

After handleWakeWordDetected, keep the audio stream active and start STT streaming.

Monitor intermediate transcripts for the phrase “go to sleep”; when detected, call stopVoiceSession() and resume passive wake-word listening.

Streaming STT with OpenAI Whisper

In voice.rs, flesh out add_audio_chunk to stream WebM/PCM chunks to transcribe_audio, handling partial results and timeouts.

Use voice_settings.voice_model (“whisper-1”) and pass session_id back to the frontend through voice-transcript events for real-time updates.

Maple TTS playback

Use speak_text with provider “openai” and voice “maple” to synthesize replies; return MP3 data and play it in the frontend whenever auto_speak_responses is true.

Optionally add “Go to sleep” voice acknowledgement via TTS when stopping the session.

Chat logging & context

ChatPanel already inserts transcripts; ensure each final STT chunk calls sendMessage() so every utterance appears in the Chat window.

Preserve messages array in appStore for full conversation history, which is already injected (with terminal output) into the LLM prompt.

Tool & file access for the LLM

Expose capability functions (read_file, write_file, execute_system_command, etc.) to the model via function-calling or MCP connectors so the model can act on files or run CLI tools inside allowed roots.

Tie those tool calls to the same permission system the GUI uses, keeping the sandboxed paths defined in settings.allowed_roots.

Claude Code CLI integration

Treat the CLI as another tool: wrap it in an MCP endpoint or a Tauri command so the LLM can send “user messages” that translate into CLI invocations. Feed CLI output back into recentTerminalOutput so it becomes part of future prompts.

Session lifecycle & threading

Maintain a global voice manager (already scaffolded in voice.rs); ensure API keys and org ID are set once.

Manage audio buffers in an async task so STT/TTs don’t block UI threads. After each session, flush remaining audio and emit final transcript.

Testing & security

Add unit tests for wake-word detection, STT/TTS responses, and file operations.

Enforce allowed-root checks inside all file‑system commands and add audit logging to record voice-triggered actions.

Commentary: once true wake-word detection and robust STT/TTS streaming are in place, LocalBrain will deliver hands-free control with full chat logging and tool access—transforming the app into a seamless voice-driven command center.

Assessment
Architecture Overview

Frontend & State – The React/Tauri desktop app centralizes configuration for voice features, including the default wake word “Hey Brain” and OpenAI’s Maple voice for responses

Voice Provider – The Rust backend exposes a VoiceProvider that supports OpenAI Whisper STT, Maple TTS, and wake‑word detection. Maple is pre‑set as the default voice and the detection routine checks incoming audio for the wake word before switching to full transcription mode

Chat Logging – Frontend components subscribe to voice-transcript events. Final transcripts are automatically inserted into the chat history and then sent to the LLM for a response, so spoken conversation appears exactly as typed messages

Backend Commands – Tauri commands handle session lifecycle and speech synthesis, defaulting to the Maple voice when a voice session starts

Tool & File Access – The capabilities module already exposes file read/write, directory listing, and system commands, giving the LLM a foundation for tool access and filesystem manipulation

Commentary:
Two voice stacks exist (providers/voice.rs and voice.rs); consolidating to one cohesive subsystem will simplify maintenance. Current wake‑word detection relies on basic transcription; integrating a dedicated keyword engine like Porcupine or open‑source alternatives would reduce latency and false positives.

Overview
LocalBrain is a Tauri 2 desktop application that combines a React front‑end with a Rust back‑end to deliver a privacy‑first command‑center for macOS power users. Core features include an always‑listening voice interface, a context‑aware chat window, and secure file/terminal controls that run locally but can opt into OpenAI services when desired.

On the front end, the WakeWordDetector component is currently a placeholder: it listens to the microphone and performs a simple energy check with a random trigger instead of a real wake‑word model.
On the back end, voice.rs already knows how to call OpenAI TTS with the “maple” voice or fall back to Piper, and it exposes hooks for speech‑to‑text and voice playback.
The project also ships a unified API layer (packages/core/src/api.ts) that exposes file read/write, command execution, and voice session controls, enabling LLM agents to manipulate the local environment.

Missing “Hey Brain / Go to Sleep” Voice Flow
Wake‑word detection

Replace the current energy‑based stub with a real wake‑word engine (e.g., Picovoice Porcupine or an OpenAI Realtime model) tuned for “Hey Brain.”

Maintain a lightweight detector running continuously, restarting after each conversation to listen for the wake word again.

Conversation lifecycle

On wake‑word detection, start a voice session via start_voice_session with tts_provider: "openai" and response_voice: "maple".

Stream microphone audio to the backend; use OpenAI’s STT or Realtime API to receive incremental transcripts and final text.

Send each transcript as a user message to useAppStore.sendMessage, which logs it in the Chat window and forwards context to the LLM.

Speak the assistant’s replies with speak_text (Maple voice).

Sleep command

During an active session, monitor transcripts for a wake‑down phrase such as “Go to sleep.”

When detected, call stop_voice_session, resume wake‑word listening, and optionally provide an audible confirmation (e.g., a short chime).

Chat logging

All transcripts and assistant replies should be pushed through the existing chat store so the conversation appears as a normal chat history.

Include recent terminal output or file diffs in the context, as already supported in useAppStore.sendMessage, to give the LLM richer awareness.

Ensuring the LLM Can Access Files & Tools
File system access

Use the API methods read_file_content, write_file_content, and list_directory to allow the LLM to inspect or modify files.

Wrap these calls with permission checks so only user‑authorized paths are reachable.

Tool execution

Expose execute_command (and any additional MCP or tool APIs) so the model can run shell commands, invoke CLI utilities, or call custom scripts.

Capture command output and feed it back into the chat context for iterative reasoning.

Security

Enforce path whitelists and command‑execution policies to prevent unintended access.

Log every file or tool operation to the audit trail, as planned in the security settings.

Implementation Guide
Backend (Rust)

Integrate a robust wake‑word detector library; expose start/stop of the detector as Tauri commands.

Extend voice.rs to handle streaming audio to OpenAI’s Realtime endpoint for low‑latency STT and TTS (Maple).

Add logic to detect “Go to sleep” from STT results and terminate sessions gracefully.

Optionally store conversation transcripts in the database/audit log.

Frontend (React/TypeScript)

Replace the placeholder detection logic in WakeWordDetector.tsx with hooks that talk to the backend wake‑word engine.

Auto‑activate VoiceRecorder when wake word fires; auto‑stop when “Go to sleep” is heard or the user manually toggles.

Append transcripts and responses to useAppStore.messages so they appear in the Chat UI.

Provide a visual indicator (e.g., glowing microphone icon) when the app is listening versus sleeping.

State & Settings

Extend appStore.ts to track wake‑word status and last interaction time.

Expose user settings (e.g., wake phrase, sensitivity, auto‑sleep timeout) in the Settings panel.

LLM & Tool Access

Ensure the LLM’s message handler can call the Tauri API methods for file and command operations.

Optionally build a “Tools” registry that maps natural‑language intents to specific APIs (e.g., read file, run tests, open editor).

Include hooks for MCP or Claude‑style toolchains if additional APIs are needed.

Testing & Validation

Unit‑test wake‑word detection and session transitions.

Simulate conversations to verify transcripts are logged, actions execute, and the system returns to listening.

Conduct security reviews on file/command access to ensure proper sandboxing.

Additional Commentary
The backend already contains a comprehensive VoiceManager; the main gap is hooking in an actual wake‑word model and streaming pipeline.

Consider leveraging OpenAI’s new Realtime Voice API (WebRTC or WebSocket) to unify STT and TTS in one session, which simplifies latency and “Go to sleep” detection.

The project’s structure is modular and already anticipates plugin/tool expansion, so once wake‑word detection is stable, the same pattern can be extended to other voice commands.

With the above architecture and steps, LocalBrain will reliably wake on “Hey Brain,” carry on a voice conversation using OpenAI’s Maple voice, log all exchanges in the Chat window, and give the LLM full controlled access to files and tools for powerful local automation.

Assessment
LocalBrain is a Tauri-based desktop app that combines a React frontend with a Rust backend for AI-powered interaction. The voice subsystem already defines a configuration that defaults to the “Hey Brain” wake word and the OpenAI “maple” voice for TTS. Voice recordings are streamed to the backend, transcribed with Whisper, and the final transcript is injected into the chat log. The backend exposes commands for file operations and shell access, allowing the LLM to read/write files and drive terminal sessions. Starting a voice session also selects “maple” as the default response voice.

The existing wake-word detection is a placeholder that transcribes short audio chunks and searches for the wake word; a comment notes that a dedicated model (e.g., Porcupine) should be used instead. No code yet responds to a “Go to sleep” phrase, so the session never shuts down automatically.

Implementation Guide
Continuous Audio Capture

Use the Web Audio API (as in WakeWordDetector.tsx) to stream PCM audio to the Rust VoiceProvider::process_audio_stream loop.

Ensure chunks are at least one second (~16 KB at 16 kHz) to support accurate wake-word detection.

Wake Word “Hey Brain”

Replace the temporary random detection in WakeWordDetector with a real wake-word engine (Porcupine, Vosk, or offline Whisper with keyword spotting).

On detection, call start_voice_session so the backend switches the session state from WaitingForWakeWord to Listening.

Speech-to-Text and Chat Logging

Continue streaming audio via voice_add_audio_chunk.

Whisper transcriptions are already emitted as voice-transcript events; keep using the existing handler that appends the final transcript to the chat as a user message.

“Go to Sleep” Phrase

After each transcription, scan the text for “go to sleep”. If found, invoke stop_voice_session to end listening.

Provide audible confirmation using speak_text with Maple voice.

Text-to-Speech Responses

When the assistant sends a reply, use speak_text to play the response aloud. The default Maple voice is already selected in start_voice_session.

Context and Tool Access

Chat messages flow through send_chat_message, enabling the LLM to see terminal output and prior conversation.

The LLM can manipulate files and terminals through the exposed Tauri commands: read_file/write_file for disk access and create_terminal/terminal_send_input for shell control.

Additional tools can be exposed as new Tauri commands or WebSocket endpoints and surfaced in the Tools tab.

Default Voice and Settings UI

Ensure the Settings panel lets users change wake_word, voice_model, and response_voice, which are already part of the app store defaults.

Persist updates via updateSettings so the backend uses the current configuration.

Security and Permissions

Respect allowed roots when reading or writing files to keep filesystem access constrained.

Confirm microphone permission at startup, and handle denial gracefully.

Commentary
The project’s IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md claims wake-word support is “complete,” but the code still contains TODO-style placeholder logic. Integrating a dedicated wake-word engine will reduce latency and false positives.

Monitoring for the “Go to sleep” phrase not only saves CPU and API usage but also prevents accidental background recording.

Consider buffering a few seconds of audio before the wake word to give the assistant context for commands spoken immediately after “Hey Brain.”

No tests were executed, as this task only involved repository analysis without modifying code.
