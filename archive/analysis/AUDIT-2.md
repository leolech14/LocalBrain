Repository Audit Summary
Recent history includes a merge commit integrating voice, terminal, and AI features, preceded by an earlier “enable file deletion” change and the initial commit

Attempting to compare the last five commits failed because only three commits exist in the repository history

Backend Rust modules containing Tauri commands include main.rs, terminal.rs, whisper.rs, and others

Frontend components using invoke calls span across terminal, chat, voice recorder, file explorer, and additional UI modules

pnpm install completed successfully with build-script warnings ignored, finishing in roughly 4.6 s

Running pnpm --filter @localbrain/desktop dev launched a Vite dev server on port 3001

The Tauri app’s backend registers numerous commands, including chat, terminal, voice, plugin, and knowledge-management operations within its invoke handler

Testing
pnpm install

pnpm --filter @localbrain/desktop dev (Vite server started, then terminated with Ctrl+C)

Notes
git diff HEAD~5..HEAD --stat failed due to insufficient commit history.

Dev server was started briefly; no feature-level manual testing was performed.
