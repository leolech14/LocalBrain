Repository Audit
Latest commits show a merge integrating voice, terminal, and AI features atop the initial commit, plus a file‑deletion feature

Recent changes touched Tauri command registration and the file explorer, adding a deletion capability and updating state management

Command registration resides across multiple Rust files, including main.rs, terminal.rs, and whisper.rs

Frontend components invoking backend commands include chat, terminal, voice recorder, file explorer, and others

Installation & Run Attempts
pnpm install completed successfully after running post-install setup

pnpm --filter apps/desktop dev failed: No projects matched the filters

Running with the correct package name (@localbrain/desktop) starts a Vite server on port 3001 (terminated manually)

Next Steps
Clarify the correct workspace filter for development commands (@localbrain/desktop).

Verify runtime behavior of chat, terminal, voice, and file explorer features once the UI is accessible.

Create an updated “truth document” capturing the actual working state after hands-on testing.
